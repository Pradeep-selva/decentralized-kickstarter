<h1 align="center">Decentralized KickStarter</h1>
<div align="center">
  <p>A funding website for startups, like <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">kickstarter</a>, but built decentralized with ethereum based on a contribute-approve model, where contributors of a campaign must approve transaction requests of campaign managers, to reduce scams.</p>
  <p>This is currently deployed on ethereum's Rinkeby Test Network.</p>
